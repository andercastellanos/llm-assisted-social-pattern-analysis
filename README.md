# llm-assisted-social-pattern-analysis

Early scaffold for a project that explores social pattern analysis assisted by LLMs.

## Getting started


## Project structure

Planned layout (adjust as you build):
- `notebooks/` – exploration and prototyping.
- `src/` – reusable modules for data loading, feature extraction, and LLM calls.
- `experiments/` – experiment configs, logs, and outputs.
- `tests/` – unit and integration tests.
